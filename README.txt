- Inspiration
During quarantine, we were struck with the inspiration of creating a dynamic, interesting and easy-to-understand method for people to practice the necessary safety measures to prevent COVID-19. To accomplish this, we decided to create an AR application that blends with your home to bring you the latest updates and tips to keep you and your family safe.

- What it does
The CovidStation project has two different stages: the Home Kit and the Countries Section.

By downloading the CovidStation Home Kit from our webpage, you can count on a multitude of tools to help you fight COVID-19. For example, by pasting the sanitizer sticker onto your home sanitizer bottle, you can easily scan the sticker using EchoAR to get a reminder of how to use the sanitizer best.

UNDER DEVELOPMENT
On the Countries Section, you can download a picture of the flags of the countries you want to keep a tab on. Then, by scanning the flag with EchoAR, you can obtain an up-to-date analysis of the number of cases, deaths and recoveries caused by COVID-19 according to WorldMeter.

- What's next for CovidStation
While this first prototype has many areas of opportunity, we hope to one day be able to work side-by-side with EchoAR to make an easy-to-access app for scanning our stickers.
